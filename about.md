My name is Darya and I am here to document and share my programming journey. As a **self taught Font-End Developer** I wanted to find a way to learn more efficiently. I read that writing about what you build allows you to get a clear and concise idea of your thinking and methods, therefore improving your learning process. 

I started my journey in 2019 with a Reponsive Web Design course from Free Code Camp, followed by the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. At that point I mastered `HTML`, `CSS` and `JS`, could work with `C` and easily wrote queries in `SQL`. I backed up these with some projects, like websites for friends, my personal portfolio and small cool applications. This landed me my internship as Front-End develper in September 2020. 

This blog picks up at the end of the internship, when I am learning `REACTjs` and some Back-End, while trying to get my first Front-End job.
